        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Rocket League is a video game that implemented car mechanics into soccer, hence came the pun "soccar."</p>

        <h2>mechanics</h2>
            <p>Just like in soccer, Rocket League, has a goal and a ball and it has the same car mechanics like other racing games, but where they differ is Rocket league implemented a boost and a jump, so in conjuction the two allow you to flight and do aerial tricks to try and confuse the enemy to score.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Initially the idea was introduced back in 2008 under the name, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars (Battle-Cars for short), but Psyonix(the maker of the game) didn't do the best at maketing it so it flopped on lauch. So, after 6 years in 2014 Psyonix finally rebooted it and called it rocket league and made a different marketing approch by giving early access codes to youtubers and twitch streamer and opened it up to alpha and beta testing to make buzz around the game. It created so much buzz that the servers could not handle the release and Psyonix had to up their sever capacity.</p>
